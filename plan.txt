we will use latex. asciimath is not powerful enough
\Box will handle blank terms, so an error never arises

honestly the biggest problem is navigation, and the biggest problem with that is the arrow keys are hard to reach

we have three options
1. vim-like normal/visual insert dichotomy
2. modifier key accesses normal/visual layer
3. navigation is neatly confined to to, backspace, enter, space

that's all. not even f keys are allowed. modifiers are allowed but modifiers + those keys tend to not work on terminal

i favour option 2, it seems the fastest

difficult navigation problems
+, -, *, / should be variadic, of course. it's more intuitive
but then say i want to change a + to -, or just navigate among the operators, that's kind of difficult now
requires more significant restructuring

reordering, fFtT, etc. are important things that can greatly improve over pen and paper
and copy-paste, of course

a thing to delete the enclosing thing (e.x. sum _ ^ ...) and free/keep the other stuff, idk

the solution is that + - * / should not be operators, they should be data

not only should highlight up and down be a thing, and moving highlight left and right, but extending highlight left and right, like shift-arrowkeys in Word, but with a better shortcut

perhaps something like 'highlight left and right, but stop before any special ops, e.x. to highlight a term in a linear combination
