we will use latex. asciimath is not powerful enough
\Box will handle blank terms, so an error never arises

honestly the biggest problem is navigation, and the biggest problem with that is the arrow keys are hard to reach

we have three options
1. vim-like normal/visual insert dichotomy
2. modifier key accesses normal/visual layer
3. navigation is neatly confined to to, backspace, enter, space

that's all. not even f keys are allowed. modifiers are allowed but modifiers + those keys tend to not work on terminal

i favour option 2, it seems the fastest

difficult navigation problems
+, -, *, / should be variadic, of course. it's more intuitive
but then say i want to change a + to -, or just navigate among the operators, that's kind of difficult now
requires more significant restructuring

2022-07-18(1)01:37:42-0400
reordering, fFtT, etc. are important things that can greatly improve over pen and paper
and copy-paste, of course

a thing to delete the enclosing thing (e.x. sum _ ^ ...) and free/keep the other stuff, idk

the solution is that + - * / should not be operators, they should be data

not only should highlight up and down be a thing, and moving highlight left and right, but extending highlight left and right, like shift-arrowkeys in Word, but with a better shortcut

perhaps something like 'highlight left and right, but stop before any special ops, e.x. to highlight a term in a linear combination

we need a fast unshifted hotkey for subscripts, and possibly exponentiation too

    # LEH i'm struggling to determine how list insertion should work
    # implementing a cursor, index, and iaIA mechanic is probably the best way to go
    # then a list CAN be focused, and when it's focused there is an index that tells you where to insert
    # but there is no dedicated insert mode
    # pressing iaIA just focuses the list in this intermediate fashion
    # and then navigating up once focuses the entire list

a different solution has been reached: a single hotkey inserts a blank to the left of any list element

list highlighting will be a background, to differentiate from highlighting elements in the list

2022-07-24(0)00:05:49-0400
it is easier to navigate upward than downward. this is why a special case for insert_data exists, when a whole list is currently focused

the USER is ALWAYS in control of exactly what happens
or, pretty much that
it's not perfectly absolute of course
but i decide what gets subscripted, etc.
however speed is still retained
predictability is the most important factor in order to achieve speed
more control is more predictability
